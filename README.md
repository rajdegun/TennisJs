# TennisJs
Set out a basic scoring systems for a Tennis Game based on the initial challenge.

In order to view my changes immediately I decided to use a light weight web app (https://github.com/wbkd/webpack-starter/blob/master/README.md). A great way to view my changes as I set up my js codebase.

My initial structure was based around basic javascript methods and really just ensuring I have catered for scoring around:

1. Love scores
2. Scores below deuce
3. Deuce scoring
4. Ad scoring
5. Game

After setting out this structure I introduced the key functions to handle the above scoring.

The next stage was to see how I could simplfy the codebase in index.js so that the application could follow some basic principles. 

Using a Score class I can better model my data and making use of the context throughout the class for the scoring scenarios.
